My database and webserver are running on AWS in seperate ubuntu instances.

To test as prototype

- Please add a venue (make sure the image is 512x512)
- Add an event using one of the venues listed in venues
- Fill out all the fields in the form
- Please drag the artifacts into the map only once
- Check that they saved by clicking on the map under events.
[note: there are still some known bugs, but the intended workflow should work]

IP address of webserver to connect: http://3.25.215.147
